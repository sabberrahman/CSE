// PRIME NUMBER = number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself...2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ... 

// 0 & 1 are not considered prime numbers, so c is set to 0, indicating a non-prime number.

//i = 2: Starting value for the loop counter, as 1 is not considered prime.

//if (c == 1): Checks the value of c. If it's still 1 (meaning no divisors were found in the loop), n is prime.
